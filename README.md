Hello everyone!
In this code I created a dynamic clock that randomly updates its font color every one second.
It also displays the day of the week and it's possible to pause the time and resume it. 
That's, when we press the "Start" button, we see the current time.
I tried to make the design a little more beautiful...
I hope you like this dynamic clock idea.
